- **Breach Notification Timelines**:
  - Regulators: 72 hours maximum
  - Individuals: Without undue delay
- **Tools**: SIEM platforms, incident management systems, communication tools

### Change Management
- **Process**: Authorization → Testing → Approval → Implementation → Verification
- **Documentation**: Change requests, test results, approval records, implementation logs
- **Automation**: Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform, ARM templates)

## Cloud Implementation Examples
